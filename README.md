## Hot Stamping Anomaly Detection System

This project aims to develop a methodology for the systematic detection of anomalies in the hot stamping process of metal blanks for car body parts, using machine learning methods. Due to demographic developments and the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, there is a need to monitor and analyze crucial process parameters to prevent losses of valuable experience and detect anomalies in real-time.

### Demonstrator Plant

The demonstrator plant comprises five main components: a material feed magazine, an industrial robot for material transfer, an annealing furnace, and a hydraulic press with a temperature-controlled hot forming tool inside. All machines have open communication interfaces with which all sensor data can be accessed, and the plant is outfitted with different sensors measuring crucial process parameters. Temperature sensors in the punch and die and structure-borne sound and mechanical vibration sensors are used to monitor the process closely.

### Machine Learning Methods
We use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques and neural networks to detect anomalies with great accuracy on our test data. The sensor data collected during the hot stamping process is analyzed using these methods, and anomalies are detected in real-time. Our goal is to develop a methodology for the systematic detection of anomalies in the hot forming process using machine learning methods that are suitable for real-time anomaly detection for a high-level control system.
